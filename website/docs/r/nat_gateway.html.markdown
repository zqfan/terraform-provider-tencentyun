resource "tencentcloud_eip" "eip_dev_dnat" {
  name = "terraform_test"
}
resource "tencentcloud_eip" "eip_test_dnat" {
  name = "terraform_test"
}

# Create NAT Gateway
resource "tencentcloud_nat_gateway" "my_nat" {
  vpc_id           = "${tencentcloud_vpc.main.id}"
  name             = "terraform test"
  max_concurrent   = 3000000
  bandwidth        = 500
  assigned_eip_set = [
    "${tencentcloud_eip.eip_dev_dnat.public_ip}",
    "${tencentcloud_eip.eip_test_dnat.public_ip}",
